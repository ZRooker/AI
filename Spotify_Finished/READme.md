Here is all the code I will submit for my final project for AI.

The notebooks consist of the individual coding and development for algorithm work. The python file song_rec brings all of the work together and uses the terminal 
to get user input. Finally, I created a website that provides an actual UI and will get the user information and dsiplay their spotify data and the new playlists. 

To run the website open up the directory in AI_Flask and run: python -m flask run

Note: app.py -> flask control
      templates -> html pages
      static -> script for user confirmation
